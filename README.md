## 💡 What is this?

ChatGPT has a **Personalization** page (sometimes called “Personality” or “Custom instructions”).

Most people never touch it.

But if you fill it *once* with good instructions, even on the **free** version, you can turn ChatGPT into a focused assistant:

* a **DevOps senior** that always answers with runbooks and commands
* a **language tutor** that explains grammar simply and gives exercises
* a **content strategist** that writes hooks and outlines for your posts
* a **career coach** that edits your CV, LinkedIn, and interview answers

This repo gives you **ready templates** for that page – so you do not have to design them yourself.

---

## 👥 Who is this for?

Anyone who uses ChatGPT regularly and wants more consistent, useful answers:

* DevOps, SRE, sysadmins, IT engineers
* Backend / frontend / software developers
* Content creators, influencers, marketers
* Language teachers, school / university teachers
* Students, exam takers (IELTS, TOEFL, school exams, university)
* Job seekers, people changing careers
* Small business owners, freelancers, coaches

If you have a role, there is a persona for you (and you can easily create your own based on these).

---

## ⚙️ How to use

### 1. Open the personalization settings

On the ChatGPT app or web:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Open **Personalization**
3. Look for:

   * **Base style and tone** (dropdown)
   * **Custom instructions** (big text box)
   * **About you** section with:

     * `Nickname`
     * `Occupation`
     * `More about you`

The exact UI may look slightly different on Free vs Premium, but the idea is always the same.

---

### 2. Choose a persona from this README

Scroll down to [Personas (copy–paste templates)](#-personas-copy–paste-templates), find your role, and:

* Copy the value for **Base style and tone**
* Copy the block under **Custom instructions**
* Copy and edit:

  * **Nickname**
  * **Occupation**
  * **More about you**

Replace all `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your own information.

---

### 3. Paste into ChatGPT

* Set the dropdown **Base style and tone**
* Paste the **Custom instructions** text into the Custom instructions box
* Fill in **Nickname**, **Occupation**, **More about you** with the blocks from this README

Save. You are done.

From now on, even with the **free** version:

* Answers become more **consistent**
* The assistant “remembers” your job and style
* You do not have to repeat who you are, every time

---

## 🧩 Field mapping

Each persona in this README uses the same field structure:

* **Base style and tone** → select from the app’s dropdown
* **Custom instructions** → one big text block that defines how ChatGPT should respond
* **Nickname** → short name ChatGPT can use for you
* **Occupation** → your job / role name
* **More about you** → 3–5 lines about what you do, your tools, and your goals

Everything is designed to work even if you have **only one Custom instructions box** (free tier).

---

* Change **Base style and tone** if you prefer more casual or more formal responses
* Add details to **More about you**:

  * tools you use
  * your country / language
  * constraints (for example: “my environment is air-gapped”, “I teach kids”, “I only work part-time”)
* Add or remove lines in **Custom instructions** if something does not fit your style
* You can even combine ideas from multiple personas (for example: “DevOps + content creator”).

---

* have an idea for a new persona (Designer, HR, Finance, Lawyer, Doctor, etc.)
